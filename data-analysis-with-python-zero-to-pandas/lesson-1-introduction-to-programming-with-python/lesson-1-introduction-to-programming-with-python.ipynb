        "Computers are useful for two purposes: storing information (also known as data) and performing operations on stored data. While working with a programming language such as Python, data is stored in variables. You can think of variables are containers for storing data. The data stored within a variable is called its value. Creating variables in Python is pretty easy, as we've already seen in the [previous tutorial](https://jovian.com/aakashns/first-steps-with-python/v/4#C15).\n",
