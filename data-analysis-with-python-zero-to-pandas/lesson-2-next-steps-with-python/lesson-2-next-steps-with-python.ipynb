Notice the four spaces before `statement1`, `statement2`, etc. The spaces inform Python that these statements are associated with the `if` statement above. This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",
        "\n",

You can run into problems if you don't use indentation properly. Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.\n",

However, it would be nice to round up the amount to full dollars, rather than including digits afer the decimal. To achieve this, we might want to write a function which can take a number and round it up to the next integer (e.g. 1.2 is rounded up to 2). That would be a good exercise to try out!\n",

This provides *encapsulation* and avoid naming conflicts between your code vs. a module, or across modules.\n",
